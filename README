Project created in 2011 by Am√©lie Benoit & Romain Chabernaud

Ant colony simulator. 


Each ant colony has warriors and workers. 

Warriors fight against other colonies' ant. A warrior fighting a worker will win. A dead ant will release a pheromon cloud to prevent workers from its colony that an enemy is around here. 

The workers are looking for food.

The colored clouds and lines correspond to pheromons. Workers will follow the line to find food and bring it back to their home, and will flee when entered into a pheromon cloud. 

Buttons have been added in a control panel in order to be able to add / remove ants, change the type of background. The button "21 Dec. 2012" correspond to a catastroph : all the ants die, and you can repopulate the game using the button "Add ant".
